# CrazyZoo

In crazy zoo live animals that sometimes do crazy things. Observing their behavior for some time we noticed that:

## Crocodile

Crocodiles follow what new animals appears in zoo, but they are really excited only when it is other crocodiles.

## Lion

Lions are lazy and usually just sleep. But if some time went and they have not been fed they start to play.

## Monkey

If try to feed monkey with a banana it throws it back.

## Owl

When owl hears that someone else makes an owl sound (types "hoo" with a keyboard) it flies to a convenient place and shares one of owl wisdoms.

## Zebra

Zebras can only eat limited amount of food.
